きょうわおぼんです! Today is Obon!

Obon is an annual three-day long Buddhist festival for honoring one's ancestors. The spirits are believed to return during this time to
visit relatives. Family members will gather together, visit graves, and make offerings to temples and alters. Other customs include dancing 
(bon odori), making and hanging lanterns, and lighting bonfires.

This Obon, you are the new caretaker of the ancient shrine in the mountains that houses the graves of 7 Japanese historical figures. The old 
caretaker disappeared under mysterious circumstances, but fear not! They have left you a handy little tome explaining all the spirits that reside
here and all the offerings you will need for the alters. The old caretaker was very familiar with these spirits, but fresh meat has come in, and
these spirits have not eaten since last year.

Appease the ghosts and may you live to tell the tale!
