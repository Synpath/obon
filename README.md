This was a simple text-based game I coded for the Culture Project in JPNS 1001. I was mildly inspired by the game, Phasmophobia, as Phasmophobia features a couple different Japanese ghosts. 

I chose 7 different historical figures in Japan to represent. Three of them, the Three Great Onryo of Japan, are a nod to the Onryo ghost type in Phasmophobia. The other 4 are lesser known female historical figures.

This project was built using HTML and JavaScript and coded in about 2.5 weeks. It is hosted through GitHub Pages.
