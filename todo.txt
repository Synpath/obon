Javascript:
===========================
// rewrite if else statement chains to be switch statements
// scramble the page order of the book 
// combine unnecessarily separate event listeners and possibly do remove eventlistener at the end of some functions

HTML/CSS:
=============================
// fix scrollbar stuff, make it transparent?
// typewriter blinking effect

Game:
================================

[1] Rewwrite the book contents to be as if the old gravekeeper actually wrote them, and not just an outsider like me

[3] implement [esc]
while writing: skip text, print out exit message
while choosing an offering: stop countdown, print out exit message
bookopen: book has to be closed
[esc] - end the game
add function to end the game at ANY POINT if the player hits [esc]
